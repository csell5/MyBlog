I have a new <strike>job</strike> role!!!

8 years ago I started my career at Microsoft. Way back then, I started in what was a consulting group who was focused at building software for financial services companies. It was a good run and I worked with an incredible set of people. Of course in any big company all great things must get changed, so what was my little ( relatively speaking ) organization was swallowed up by the larger consulting monster. That lasted a couple of years and then I started to search for my next journey. That meant interviewing with the Team Foundation Server team. If you knew me back then, I was pretty damn involved with the TFS team and was lucky enough to do some really cool stuff with that product. Now, I live outside of Chicago and MSFT is of course in Redmond Washington, so I am proximity challenged to say the least. Long story made short, I eventually ended up in DPE ( Developer Platform and Engineering ), the field side for those who keep up with MSFT politics .

My time in DPE afforded me the ability to spend a deep amount of time in our community and that was just awesome. I really enjoyed the memories and working with people in a capacity one could only imagine. It's an organization which was completely opposite of the my consulting experience. I'm a huge believer our community and the  people around it. So many people pour their heart and souls into making everyone in our industry just a little better. I certainly hope, I've been able help a few people along the way.

What does this mean for my community involvement? *Nothing* really, I love being actively involved in the community and [That Conference](http://thatconference.com) should be a good sign of that... I will continue to do what I do and hopefully have a bigger impact than I've been able to have in the past. I have been cooking up some crazy ideas that I hope to start on after this year's [That Conference](http://thatconference.com). Maybe [Mark](http://marknic.com) and I will even get [Developer Smackdown](http://developersmackdown.com) back up and running and finally finish that garage door project we've been working on for too long.

So what is my new job? Well, ironically I am now working for DPE but on the corporate side of things. I'm part of a [unique team](http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-builds-a-deep-tech-team-to-attract-next-gen-developers-7000015270/) who spends half of their time helping customers ship their top projects and the other half building product for Microsoft. My primary focus will continue to be Windows 8 and the web stack, I can't leave that right? Nope. I love to build software and I love to help customers, and this is a perfect blend of product development while still helping customers and I still get to live in Chicago. 

I would be lying if I didn't say I was just a little excited to be part of the engine and working with some really smart peeps. I am really hoping I will have the opportunities to take the past 8 years in the field and influence a little change, make a little awesome and drink a couple beers along the way. Here's to writing code and chasing your passion!
