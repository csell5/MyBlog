It's always nice to share your tools of the trade with fellow colleagues. I was going to compile my own list when I was passed [<FONT color=#667755>Scott Hanselman's</FONT>](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2005UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolList.aspx). I think I shall pass, he did a great job of covering things.

Thanks to Mike Becker for sharing it with me.
