I was given the opportunity to speak at this years [<FONT color=#667755>Microsoft Financial Services Developer Conference</FONT>](http://www.financialdevelopers.com/fsdevcon05.aspx). I was asked to speak on Web Services and WSE in regards to an [<FONT color=#667755>Allstate web service case study </FONT>](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/casestudies/CaseStudy.asp?CaseStudyID=16352)Microsoft published earlier this year. 

Rather than just talking about the case study one could just read, I recreated that project in .Net 2.0 using WSE 2.0 SP3\. This gave me an opportunity to illustrate some of the new features coming and how the original solution may change when .Net 2.0 is released.

The slides and videos have just been released [<FONT color=#334422>here </FONT>](http://www.financialdevelopers.com/fsdevcon05.aspx).
