First let me say this book is very well written. Throughout my career I have read a large number of books, publications and whitepapers and nothing has read as well as this. The content is very well organized and the material is illustrated in such a way where it can be read by all levels of technical staff. Anyone who has any SOA involvement be it development to management should read this book before doing anything. The use of case studies really relates the entire book to ones own organization where they can start to compare and contrast either how they have implemented SOA or might like to. As I was reviewing this book I in fact started to re-architect SOA systems I was building.
