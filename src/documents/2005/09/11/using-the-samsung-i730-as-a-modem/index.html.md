On your phone enter **7284\. This is a short cut that takes you to the Data Connection screen which offers three options:

<LI>As the modem through USB 
<LI>As the modem through Bluetooth 
<LI>Internal Data Call 

Select the first choice and your PC will now recognize it as a modem. ** NOTE ** Every time you change your battery this reset to its default ( Internal Data Call ).

Next install the drivers and create a new dial up modem network connection. Get the latest Samsung CDMA drivers at the [<FONT color=#667755>Samsung Drivers Page</FONT>](http://www.samsung.com/download/#). Use the same dial up settings your phone is using.
