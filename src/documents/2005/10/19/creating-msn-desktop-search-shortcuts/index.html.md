Creating MSN Desktop shortcuts is easy. The following is an example which creates a shortcut which will search a particular SharePoint site.

Copy this into the desktop search box...
@someweb,http://someweb/search.aspx?k=$w

Now you can search SomeWeb by typing:
someweb search_string

Thank you to Elizabeth Caley for sharing the tip.
