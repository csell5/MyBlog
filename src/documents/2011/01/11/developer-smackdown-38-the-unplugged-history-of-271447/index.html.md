In this off topic musing, Clark and Mark attempt to chat about Clark's professional career.&#160; It really didn't go how we thought it might when we talked about the idea in the first place, so why bother editing? We leave this one basically the way it got recorded. Have a behind the scenes look as we try to look inside Clark's career. Hopefully his badge still works after we publish this.
