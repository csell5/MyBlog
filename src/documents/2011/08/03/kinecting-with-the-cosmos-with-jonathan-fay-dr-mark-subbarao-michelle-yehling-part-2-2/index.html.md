## Who is:

**Jonathan Fay**: Principal Software Architect on Microsoft Research's Worldwide Telescope project in the Next Media Research group at Microsoft. He has been at Microsoft for over 16 years and his area of expertise is the visualization of data over remote networks. He lead the development of several Microsoft projects such as: Microsoft Image Composer, Microsoft Home Advisor, Microsoft bCentral Site Manage, and MSN AdExpert. He is also an avid "amateur" astronomer who even built his own personal domed observatory.

**Dr. Mark SubbaRao**: Astronomer and Director of the Space Visualization Laboratory at the Adler Planetarium. He is also a senior research associate at the University of Chicago. His area of research is cosmology, particularly the large-scale structure of galaxies, their clustering properties and evolution. He was a builder of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, working as a developer of their spectroscopic software that measured redshifts, hence providing 3D positions for nearly one million galaxies and quasars. In the Space Visualization Laboratory, Dr. SubbaRao supervises the development of scientific visualizations utilizing cutting edge stereoscopic and ultra-high resolution displays.

**Michelle (Nichols) Yehling**: Besides being Mark's sister, Michelle is Master Educator for NASA Forum Programs at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. She is currently working on several projects with NASA - one of which is Education and Public Outreach for the [Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft](http://www.ibex.swri.edu/index.shtml).

**Special note**: Great thanks go to Jonathan, Dr. SubbaRao and Michelle for spending so much time with me in recording this podcast. They are an inspiration with the passion they demonstrate in their work and their desire to pass on their knowledge to others.
