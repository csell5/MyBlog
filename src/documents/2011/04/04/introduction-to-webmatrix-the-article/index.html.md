Finally after almost of 4 months of waiting, my [Introduction to WebMatrix](http://on.csell.net/e1dvRs) article has shipped in this months MSDN Magazine. I guess they save the best for last ![Winking smile](wlEmoticon-winkingsmile_2.png) If you don't get the magazine you can view it online here: [http://on.csell.net/e1dvRs](http://on.csell.net/e1dvRs). At the very end of the article I also referenced a resource link bundle which is here: [http://on.csell.net/IntroToWebMatrix](http://on.csell.net/IntroToWebMatrix).

### First Ever

This was a first for me. It was an good experience and one of which I hope to build upon.&#160; When I finished I wrote up a little [post on my experience](http://on.csell.net/h6qPRR).

### Thanks
I have to personally thank [Brandon Satrom](http://userinexperience.com) once again for all of the help and pushing me over the cliff. This is something I've always wanted to do and his mentorship was great. I also want to thank [@davebost](http://twitter.com/daveBost), [@sseely](http://twitter.com/sseely), [@humanCompiler](http://twitter.com/humancompiler), [@mark_nic](http://twitter.com/mark_nic) and my wife for all of their help and support. Of course thank you to the staff at MSDN for questioning everything, they are amazing.
