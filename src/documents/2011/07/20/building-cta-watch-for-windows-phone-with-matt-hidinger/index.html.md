### What is CTA Watch?

> Never miss a bus or a train again. Never find yourself waiting and freezing at a stop in the harsh Chicago winters. With CTA Watch you will always know the perfect time to leave your home or office. By tapping into real-time transit information for all of the CTA's buses or trains, CTA Watch can locate nearby stops and quickly give you the next arrivals with minimal effort. We fully embrace the glance-and-go philosophy of Window Phone, allowing you to mark your most frequently traveled routes and stops as Favorites. Now every time you launch CTA Watch it will automatically display the Next Arrivals right on your home screen, so you can get in, get out, and back to life.
