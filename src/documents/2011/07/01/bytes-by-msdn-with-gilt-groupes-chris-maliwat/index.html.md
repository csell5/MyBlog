[SxSW](http://sxsw.com) seems like it so long ago. During SxSW I had a chance to spend a day interviewing a number of thought leaders like Chris. Chris works over at [Gilt Groupe](http://www.gilt.com) and we had a chance to talk about how Gilt is using some of the new IE9 features such as site pinning to bring a more interactive experience to their customers. Gilt is a pretty sweet and seeing how they implemented things was great.

Big thank you to Chris for taking the time to meet with me.
