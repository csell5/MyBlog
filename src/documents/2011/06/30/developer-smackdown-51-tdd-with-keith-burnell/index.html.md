## Show Notes

In this episode, we talk to Keith Burnell, a Software Engineer with [Skyline Technologies](http://www.skylinetechnologies.com/Pages/Default.aspx) in Green Bay, Wisconsin about a topic near and dear to all three of us: **Test Driven Development**.

We discuss Inversion of Control (IOC), Dependency Injection, behavior, mocks/stubs/fakes, what unit testing really means and why we create them religiously on each project we work on.
