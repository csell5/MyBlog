Thank you for the support, [Developer Smackdown](http://developersmackdown.com/) is 2!?!? Yes you heard it right. 50 shows in 2 years. Clark and [Mark](http://marknic.net) start the show musing a bit and then dive into how might you learn using NuGet as an example.

## Show Notes

Thank you for all the support over the past 2 years. For our 2 year anniversary and show #50 we went to our old watering hole, [Hooters in Schaumburg](http://www.bing.com/maps/#bGlkPXluMjY3eDMzNjcwMDkx).&#160; Sorry for the background noise, I guess it's part of the experience. 

Clark has been asking a lot of questions these days and the current one is "how do you learn"? Using [NuGet](http://nuget.org/) as an example Clark and Mark explore how people might in fact learn of NuGet's existence and why that might be the case. You can find more about NuGet at [NuGet.org](http://nuget.org).

[Travis](http://therobotgeek.com) and Ian, we love you guys! Keep up all the awesome you do.
