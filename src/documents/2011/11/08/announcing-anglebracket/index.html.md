In partnership with the [Lake County .NET Users' Group](http://lcnug.org/Home.aspx) I'm happy to announce [angleBracket](http://anglebracket.net/). [angleBracket](http://anglebracket.net/) is a new pair-up where web enthusiasts who collect once a month to tackle a given topic. 

The format is simple. Every month we take a single topic and explore it. 

*   10 - 15 minutes of quick introduction.
*   pair-up in groups and start to explore the technology through the art of code
*   Regroup and share with the group.  

Laptops and Redbulls not included!

Our first meeting will be held at the College of Lake County on January 19th at 7pm. We're going to tackle **WebSockets**.

We're still working out a few of the logistical details but we will update you as necessary. 

I hope to see you there!
