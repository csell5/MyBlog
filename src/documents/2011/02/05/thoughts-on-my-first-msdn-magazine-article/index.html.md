Yesterday I finished the final review on my first MSDN article. Surprised? Actually, I am too. I don't consider myself a good writer whatsoever.&#160; I started blogging ( if you can call it that ) many many years ago just to force myself to write.&#160; Honestly I'm terribly slow, can't spell, and one might think that English isn't even my native language. Regardless, I keep trying. 

My article will hit the stands in April, but until then I wanted to do a brain dump of my experience before I call the finalizer on it. Let's start with some overall context about the article:

*   Title: Introduction to [WebMatrix](http://asp.net/webmatrix), so it's an "intro" article.
*   Published in MSDN Magazine
*   ~4k words or 13 pages ( in Microsoft Word )
*   5 peer reviewers*   Sample code*   2 review cycles with peers **before** the first draft was submitted
*   ~100 hours of work overall, spread over 3 weeks  

Looking back at my experience here are some of my overall random thoughts of course in no particular order:

*   I started with a&#160; brainstorm.&#160; I am a mind map kinda guy so I used that to dump random thoughts and then organized from there.
*   I tried to pretend as if I was the reader and ask myself a few questions:
*   **WHY** would someone want to read this.*   **WHAT** are you going to get out of reading it.
*   Would I **WANT** read it?*   Try to *catch* the reader in the first 2 paragraphs, otherwise they won't get to the rest.*   I had my wife read it.&#160; She was INVAUABLE to my overall success.&#160; She isn't a techie, but her perspective is very unique. If she can understand it, I know my communication skills were good.*   Don't get hung up on order.&#160; I "refactored" my article ~10 times. I think of it like code.&#160; If it's factored right in the first place refactoring isn't a big deal.
*   Take it a section at a time.&#160; Keeping the momentum going was essential for me.&#160; It's really easy for me to get mired in something and then end up getting stalled.
*   Write you're abstract and sit on it. At least for me, in doing so I tend to think about the overall solution and have move of it figured out in my head before I get into the details.
*   **Stay focused and watch the scope creep**.&#160; It's so easy to get carried away. Remember you only have a limited amount of space and time. Keep to the point and stay concise.*   Write in active voice. I'm still learning what this really means. [http://www.dailywritingtips.com/active-voice/](http://www.dailywritingtips.com/active-voice/)
*   If you're a loan author remember it's "I" not "We".
*   When you read your own article you will actually see words that are not there. The word 'the' is a good example.
*   Pick good reviewers. I look for a few things:
        *   Not afraid to hurt feelings, this is a place where honesty is very important.
    *   Someone close to the topic.&#160;*   Someone not close to the topic.*   Good at grammar.*   Don't be afraid to ask for help. I didn't do this alone by any stretch.*   The article changed drastically from the first draft to the last.&#160; It's also much better.*   An outline format works better for items like the steps a reader should take.  

I am no expert and in fact I am a noob, but I hope this was at least somewhat helpful. I hope you check it out when it hits the stands, I would love any feedback.
