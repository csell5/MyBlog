During my trip to SxSW I had a chance to interview Ziad Ismail.&#160; Ziad is the Director of Product Management for Internet Explorer and we discussed IE9's new notification feature and "pinning" and give context to what "putting sites at the center" means for developers. Ziad also announces "Dev Unplugged", the IE9 developer contest with over $40,000 in prizes. That's some coin!!
