I wanted to take a brief moment and provide a brief update on Midwest GiveCamp. 

First I want to thank everyone who has reached out to support us, it's honestly very overwhelming. 

We have indeed kicked off the planning process for v2\. We are in the VERY early stages but nerveless things are starting to move forward. Our *very initial* plan is to "attach" it to [thatConference](http://thatconference.com/) and do a few special things between the two efforts. This would mean we would lead into [thatConference](http://thatconference.com/), August 10 - 12 2012 at the Kalahari Resort in the WI Dells. Having said that, we're still working on securing the venue, etc.

Just because we're going to have this one in WI doesn't mean we won't select charities across the Midwest. Like last time, the entire Midwest is fair game, it's all about finding the right charities.

Many of you have asked for more information or to be kept up to date as things progress. We now have a newsletter! Feel free to register for up to date information @ [http://tinyletter.com/Midwest-GiveCamp](http://tinyletter.com/Midwest-GiveCamp "http://tinyletter.com/Midwest-GiveCamp")

If you're interested in being part of the planning process or sponsoring please feel free to reach out to me directly.
