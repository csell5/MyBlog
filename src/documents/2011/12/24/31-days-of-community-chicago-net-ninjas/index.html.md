Chicago .NET Ninjas is a small group of software developers who meet to share knowledge and experience on development with the Microsoft stack. A typical meeting consists of a presentation with code examples as well as roundtable discussion. Topics range from the basic to the advanced, from web to desktop apps, and from Microsoft to open source. The goal of each meeting is for everyone to walk away having learned something to improve their skills. As there are many solutions to a problem, open discussion proves to be just as valuable as the presentation itself.
