Rockford (Northern IL/Southern WI) area .NET enthusiasts and other locals interested in computer programming topics primarily based on and/or using Microsoft technologies. All skill levels are welcome. Monthly [![untitled](untitled_thumb.png "untitled")](http://csell.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/untitled.png)meetings generally cover one or two specific topics given by a presenter with ample time for Q&A. The group's vision is to provide members with a forum to hear top industry experts speak, learn, and teach others who are interested in the same technologies as you and are facing the same challenges. The Rockford .NET Users Group covers the entire spectrum of .NET technologies, including the .NET Enterprise Servers, XML web services, application development with Visual Studio, and the .NET Framework (including web, mobile, and desktop applications); we also cover other Microsoft technologies such as Windows Phone 7 and related relevant programming topics (such as open source technologies). You are welcome to bring your laptop with you to follow along (internet access is limited when it is available). Most meetings also have pizza served (thank you to our sponsors!!), and some of us go out for self-purchased beverages after the meeting at various establishments nearby the meeting location for further informal discussions.  <p>For specific meeting topics and to RSVP, visit our page on Meetup.com under "Northern IL .NET Users Group," join our LinkedIn group, and follow us on Twitter @RockfordDotNet<a name="_GoBack"></a>
