![Sangamon Valley .NET User Group (SVNUG) Logo](svnug-logo.png)

The [Sangamon Valley .NET User Group (SVNUG)](http://www.svnug.com/) is a Microsoft .NET user group based in Springfield, Illinois.&#160; Founded in November 2010, SVNUG's mission is to encourage .NET development, research, and education in the Springfield, Illinois, technical community.&#160; We meet once a month of an evening for a presentation on a current .NET topic.

For each of our talks, we produce a collection of source code and slides for our members and other .NET enthusiasts to reference as well as a video of the talk on both our [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/svnug/videos) and [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/channels/194121) channels.&#160; Our two most popular videos are Scott Hembrough's presentation "Build Automation and Continuous Integration with TFS 2010" and Keith Reichert and Matt Havenar's presentation "Expression Blend 4 with WPF":

Allen is currently a Software Development Consultant with [Capitol Strategies, Inc.](http://www.cap-strategies.com/)-a software consulting firm based out of Springfield, Illinois.&#160; While Allen has a great deal of experience in product development, frameworks, multi-threaded programming, and all that fun stuff, he currently enjoys helping his clients build their own business-critical applications.&#160; Allen is the Public and Member Relations Officer for the [Sangamon Valley .NET User Group (SVNUG)](http://www.svnug.com/).&#160; When he is not coding, Allen enjoys spending time with his fianc√© Amanda and their houseful of pets.

### <font style="font-weight: bold">Brandon Stricker ' </font>[<font style="font-weight: bold">http://nodnarb.net</font>](http://nodnarb.net)

By day, Brandon is a systems engineer for [Levi, Ray & Shoup, Inc. (LRS)](http://www.lrs.com/) in Springfield, Illinois.&#160; By night (and sometimes on the weekends), Brandon enjoys photography and videography-which is lucky for us because, without Brandon's passion, enthusiasm, and knack for professional-grade video work, SVNUG would not have so many wonderful videos to share with its members and the .NET community at large.&#160; A newlywed, Brandon enjoys spending time with his wife June.&#160; Thankfully, June lets us borrow him and his camera a couple nights a month.

### <font style="font-weight: bold">Mark Lovik</font>

Mark is currently a consultant with [Capitol Strategies, Inc.](http://www.cap-strategies.com/) in Springfield, Illinois.&#160; With a doctorate in Physics and a penchant for taking on Herculean software development projects, Mark tends to be a busy guy.&#160; Even so, Mark enjoys developing new ideas for talks, blogs, and videos for SVNUG and spending time with his family.

### <font style="font-weight: bold">Matt Wilson</font>

Matt is currently an Enterprise Architect with [Horace Mann Educators Corporation](http://www.horacemann.com/) in Springfield, Illinois.&#160; Matt loves patterns and UML.&#160; Which he loves more, know one will ever know.&#160; When he is not busy working or advising the group on complicated business and compliance issues (okay, they are not complicated to him, but they are to the rest of us), Matt enjoys spending time with his family.

### <font style="font-weight: bold">Keith Reichert</font>

Keith is a Software Engineer with [Levi, Ray & Shoup, Inc. (LRS)](http://www.lrs.com/) in Springfield, Illinois.&#160; Although he loves writing video capturing and editing software for [LRS Sports Edge](http://www.lrs.com/lrssports/), he also loves spending time with his family.&#160; Keith is one of the four original founders of SVNUG.

### <font style="font-weight: bold">David McDaniel</font>

David is a Senior Developer/Analyst with [Levi, Ray & Shoup, Inc. (LRS)](http://www.lrs.com/) in Springfield, Illinois.&#160; When David is not lamenting Allen's inability to pay attention to anything, he is spending time with his wonderful family.&#160; David is also one of the four original founders of SVNUG and a former educator.
