Lake County .NET Users' Group meets the second Thursday of the month at the College of Lake County in Grayslake. The group started in 2008 when a couple of developers decided that they wanted to have a .NET Users' Group that was closer to their own backyard. At any given meeting, you can sharpen your tools while diving into the advanced topics in ASP.NET development, learn about an interesting corner you have never explored like Visio integration with BizTalk, or see how .NET developers can build applications for robots, phones, and other devices. Most meetings have between 20 and 40 fellow developers. Afterwards, we always head a few blocks over to Bill's Pub and jabber over peanuts and drinks. Anyone and everyone is invited to the meetings and to join us afterwards!
