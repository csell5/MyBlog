Software Craftsmanship McHenry County exists to bring developers in and around McHenry County together to share ideas on how to create better software, provide more value and cultivate professional growth throughout their careers.

At SCMC we are platform-blind and language-blind. Our only goal is to help everyone grow as software developers whether they're working on enterprise-level Microsoft systems or working on the hottest VC-backed startup this side of Silicon Valley. We love you all. Our meetings have ranged from Uncle Bob extolling the virtues of decoupling our objects from their persistence to hacking on Clojure Koans for a couple hours. 

We meet on the third Tuesday of each month at Follet Software Company in McHenry, Illinois. Meetings start at 6:00 PM to allow for people driving and usually wrap up by 8:30 PM. Food and refreshments are courtesy of 8th Light and Groupon.

Our meetings are recorded and you can see past meetings and learn about the upcoming topics at [http://mchenry.softwarecraftsmanship.org](http://mchenry.softwarecraftsmanship.org).

## Who:

**Michael D. Hall, Founder**

Back in Ole Aught-Nine Mike looked around and saw no software developer community near his home in Crystal Lake, Illinois. So he proclaimed, "Nay, this shall NOT suffice." and set out to found the McHenry Cloud Developer's Group, whose first meeting was held in the lavishly appointed basement of the Crystal Lake Public Library. After a year of holding meetings in such opulent settings as Panera and a pub bar, he sat down with Jim and Ryan to formulate the plan to find a permanent home for the group and lay out the charter for what ultimately was to become our beloved "Software Craftsmanship McHenry County." Today the group has grown to an average meeting size of over 15 attendees and enjoys ongoing sponsorships from several reputable companies that share in the values at the heart of software craftsmanship.
