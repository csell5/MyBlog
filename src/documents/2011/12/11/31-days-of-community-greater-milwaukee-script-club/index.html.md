The Greater Milwaukee Script Club is an informal group that focuses on hands on use of PowerShell, an automation framework.&#160; Script Clubs are like a hands on lab with no set topic or teacher.&#160; You bring an idea for a script and ask your fellow PowerShell users for help getting the script written.

There are eight rules of Script Club - 
  > 1\. You Always Talk About Script club      
> 2\. You Always Talk About Script Club       
> 3\. If Someone asks for Help, And You Can Help, You Help       
> 4\. Two People Help One Person at One Time       
> 5\. One Module Per Person Per Night       
> 6\. All Scripts, All PowerShell       
> 7\. Scripts will be as short as they can be       
> 8\. If This is your First time at Script Club, You Have to Script
