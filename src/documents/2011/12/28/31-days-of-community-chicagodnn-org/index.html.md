We are the Chicago Area DotNetNuke Users Group and we promote DotNetNuke within the Chicagoland area. If you develop websites or work with website technology then you should know about us.[![image](image_thumb5.png "image")](http://csell.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image5.png)

DotNetNuke is a very powerful Content Management System for developing websites. Great websites in fact...

Our Hosting Sponsor PowerDNN provides food and drink for the evening and we generally have a great discussion about all things web related. You are welcome to attend this free event, contribute to the discussion, ask questions and take off if the conversation no longer is relevant to you.
