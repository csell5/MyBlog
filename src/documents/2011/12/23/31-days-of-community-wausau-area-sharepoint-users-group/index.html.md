The Wausau Area SharePoint Users Group is a new group trying to get its feet on the ground. Our group meets monthly to share presentations on new topics. We offer our meeting both at New Horizons and via remote access--so you don't need to come to Wausau, Wisconsin, to participate in our group.

In 2012, we are looking to develop our web page sponsored by New Horizons and provide our members with programs that help educate them in the use of SharePoint.
