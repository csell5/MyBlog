The Central Ohio Windows Phone User Group (COWPUG) has been established to nurture knowledge base and collaboration among Windows Phone developers & enthusiasts. While we are primarily based in Columbus OH, developers from all around Ohio, neighboring states and just about anybody who has interest in Windows Phone is most welcome.

With all that's happening in the Windows Phone ecosystem, we needed a dedicated forum to talk about upcoming technologies, architectures & development paradigms around working on the Windows Phone platform. Our focus is both Silverlight & XNA development, so that we appeal to all kinds of Windows Phone developers. We are recognized by INETA & collaborate with other similar User Groups to have some of the best speakers/experts in the Windows Phone space. In all, a great group of passionate Windows Phone developers, geeking out over latest technology & sharing experiences.
