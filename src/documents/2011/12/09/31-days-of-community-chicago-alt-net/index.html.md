Sergio Pereira is a Lead Software Engineer at a large, global Legal Software company, based in Chicago. For the longest time Sergio has had his eyes in the development of richer and more usable web sites. He believes in using the most basic tools to create web applications, while at the same time not giving up productivity. He's a strong believer in continuous improvement of individuals, the processes, and the tools used in the software craft.

For those times when a break from programming is in order, you'll find Sergio hanging out with his wife or watching a good soccer game - often both things at the same time.
