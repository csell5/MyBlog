The SharePoint Users Group of Indiana is a group that meets every month to talk about SharePoint. On the Third Wednesday of **odd (January, March, May, July, September, November)** months we meet at 11:30 at the Microsoft office in Indianapolis to share the business value of SharePoint. On the Third Wednesday of **even (February, April, June, August, October)** months we meet at 5:30 at the Microsoft office in Indianapolis to share technical details of how to make SharePoint work.

The group is one of the oldest SharePoint groups in the country having started in 2005\. Each month approximately 50 professionals join together to listen to a presentation, network, and, of course, eat pizza.
