Introduced as an alternative to after-work meetings on Madison's far-east side, The Geek Lunch is a "watercooler discussion" by a collective of software developers with all levels of skill.&#160; Held once a month on the South Side of Madison over the noon hour, it gives independent developers an opportunity to meet face-to-face with other developers to discuss problems, share ideas, and generally learn from each other.&#160; We do not have a set agenda or meeting leader. One or two people will get there lunch on the house, thanks to one of our generous sponsors: Beacon Technologies and Safe Bridge Solutions, and someone else will will a month of free training from PluralSight.
