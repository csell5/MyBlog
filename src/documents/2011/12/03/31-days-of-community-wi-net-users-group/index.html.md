[![clip_image002](clip_image002_thumb.png "clip_image002")](http://csell.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/clip_image002.png)The WI .NET Users Group was formed in February 2002, when the Visual Studio .NET was first released. Each month we meet for a couple hours to network, eat some pizza and talk about code.

Come join us. All are welcome. Maybe we'll even have cake for our 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary in February.

## Who:

Scott Isaacs ' [http://tapmymind.com](http://tapmymind.com)<u> </u>

Born and raised in California, Scott moved to Wisconsin just in time to celebrate the Y2K non-crisis. After spending most of the last 12 years doing some form of consulting (there was that 16 months he worked for a bank, but doesn't like to talk about that much), Scott is now the .NET Solutions Director at SafeNet Consulting in Milwaukee, WI. Scott's favorite pastime is spending time with his wife and two children. His greatest concern is figuring out how he can safely root for the 49ers if they meet the Packers in the playoffs this year.
