The Chicago ALM User Group is a user group that meets monthly to discuss all things ALM and Visual Studio tooling that enables teams to develop better software within their organizations.&#160; The key mission of this user group is to foster the community of people both using the ALM tools from Microsoft, implementing the ALM tools from Microsoft, and those that are interested in ALM - in general.
