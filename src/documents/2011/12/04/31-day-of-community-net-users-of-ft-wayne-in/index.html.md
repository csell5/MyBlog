Armanda Turney <u>[http://armanda.com](http://armanda.com)</u>

Armanda is a freelance web designer and marketing consultant with clients nationwide as well as in the Ft. Wayne area. Armanda attended the University of Tampa and graduated with a few science related B.S. degrees. She took a few years off when her children were younger and returned to the work force in 1999 as a full time web developer and consultant. At one point, Armanda oversaw the Merchant Account program at a local bank. That experience coupled with her marketing, & computer experience along with a little scientific method to get things done, provided a strong background to make the jump to the web. Armanda has recently accepted the volunteer position of Ineta Representative for Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky.
