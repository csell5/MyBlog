We are a group of professionals and students, residing in the Chicago area, who develop or plan to develop apps for Windows Phone 7\. If you are or would like to develop for the Windows Phone Marketplace then this is the group for you.[![image](image_thumb1.png "image")](http://csell.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image1.png)
The group provides knowledge sharing, an exchange of ideas, and professional networking at monthly meetings. Most meeting will have both structured and unstructured elements. The structured portion will usually consist of presentations and technical demonstrations. The unstructured elements provide time for individual and group discussions, personal networking, as well as show-and- tell of your latest or favorite app.
