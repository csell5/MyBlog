ECRuby is the Eau Claire, Wisconsin's Ruby user group. We meet monthly to discuss topics related to Ruby development, but we often branch out into other areas, like web development, jQuery, CoffeeScript, databases, web services, and pretty much anything our group wants to learn about.[![image](image_thumb2.png "image")](http://csell.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image2.png)

Our goal is to promote open-source development and education by using one of the most powerful dynamic languages available. Whether you're experienced, just starting out, or have never even seen Ruby, we welcome you to our group, to learn and share with others the amazing things that Ruby can do.
