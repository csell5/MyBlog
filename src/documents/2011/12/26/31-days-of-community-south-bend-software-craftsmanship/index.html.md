SOBESC (South Bend Software Craftsmanship) The South Bend Software Craftsmanship group meets regularly to uphold and proliferate the values of the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto:[![image](image_thumb4.png "image")](http://csell.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image4.png)

*   Not only working software, but also well-crafted software
*   Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value
*   Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals
*   Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships  

If you are interested in connecting with and learning from other like-minded software artisans in the South Bend area, please sign up and join us at our next meetup.
