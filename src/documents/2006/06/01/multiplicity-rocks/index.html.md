Like any good geek I have a ton of different machines and always seem to work work off a few monitors at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have a few monitors I really didn't&nbsp;need a KVM but I needed a way to get rid of&nbsp;the stacks of keyboards and mice, [Multiplicity](http://www.stardock.com/products/multiplicity/)!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just installed the trial version&nbsp;and it just rocks.
