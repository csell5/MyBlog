I don't think anyone will argue but the majority of technical books are used for reference.&nbsp; OK so every so often a new book comes out and you read it cover to cover.&nbsp; Well that time has come.&nbsp; 

[Vincent Maraia](http://blogs.msdn.com/vincem) has just authored a book called [The Build Master](http://www.bookpool.com/ss?qs=0321332059).&nbsp; If you have <U>anything</U> to do with software development then you **<U>MUST</U>** read this book.&nbsp; I don't care how good you are, how many products you shipped or if you are already a build master, you **<U>MUST</U>** read this book.

Every development shop must address most if not all of the topics found in this book.&nbsp; If you're not, then you really need to invest some time and money in yourself and clean shop.&nbsp; I guarantee things could be better.&nbsp; Just ask yourself a few questions:

If you have answered No to any of these questions then just go buy it now and start reading.&nbsp; Again regardless no matter who you are, you still need to read this book.

[Vincent Maraia](http://blogs.msdn.com/vincem), <U>Great Read </U>and <U>Great Job</U>!!! I&nbsp;can't wait for the next one.
