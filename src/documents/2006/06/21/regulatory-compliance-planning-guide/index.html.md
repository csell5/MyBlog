I happen to work in the Financial Services vertical and it seems daily you hear someone talking about compliance.&nbsp; This topic is usually a mystery to most people except the lawyers.&nbsp; Well the&nbsp;Microsoft Solutions for Security and Compliance (MSSC) team published the [Regulatory Compliance Planning Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56114), which is also available for [download](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56419) as a Word doc.

If you deal with any of the following you will want to read.

Thanks [Rob&nbsp;Caron](http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron)&nbsp;for the post.
