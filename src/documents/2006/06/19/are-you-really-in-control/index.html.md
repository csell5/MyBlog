Last night I'm sitting on the couch coding away when suddenly mouse and keyboard were taken over and controlled by someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a total panic I try and close down everything of which has a connection to the Internet.&nbsp; Things stop!&nbsp; At this point I am in total awe at what just happened.&nbsp; I start looking at security logs, firewalls etc, and just come up blank.

So I fire things back up and just sit there watching.....&nbsp; Nothing; OK weird.&nbsp; Start coding again and BAM, the keyboard and mouse have been hijacked again.&nbsp; Out of the corner of my eye I happened to catch my wife walking into the office.&nbsp; Thinking that she was playing some kind of weird really elaborate prank on me, I head into the office.&nbsp; I walk in and she says "something is wrong with this computer, my mouse and keyboard just disappear".&nbsp; I replied, "would you move that mouse again"?&nbsp; Sure enough that mouse is moving the pointer on my laptop.&nbsp; I just stood there in awe, how could this be?

Multiplicity!!&nbsp; DOOOOHHHHHHH!!!

My laptop happens to be the "next" computer to the one she happened to be working on.&nbsp; As she would reach the screen edge it would take control of mine.&nbsp; It just never dawned on me to shut down the Multiplicity service when I didn't have my laptop docked in the office.

Moral of story, shut down that ole KM software you are running when you are not at your station!&nbsp; You never really know who's in control.
