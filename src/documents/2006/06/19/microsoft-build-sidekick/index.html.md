I have decided there are not enough people blogging about MSBuild, so here is the first post of many more to come.&nbsp; 

I ran across a free MSBuild editor the other day made by [Attrice](http://attrice.info/) called [Microsoft Build Sidekick](http://attrice.info/msbuild/).&nbsp; I've loaded it up and I am impressed.&nbsp; I especially love the feature where you can look at all of the items your build file imported.&nbsp; 

Add it to your toolbox @ [http://attrice.info/msbuild/](http://attrice.info/msbuild/)
