Mark Seemann recently published a great post demonstrating the&nbsp;use of [anonymous methods](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0yw3tz5k.aspx) in unit testing events.&nbsp;&nbsp;[Testing Events Using&nbsp;Anonymous Methods](http://blogs.msdn.com/ploeh/archive/2006/01/19/TestingEventsUsingAnonymousMethods.aspx)

That just rocks, thanks Mark!
