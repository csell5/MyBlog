I started to host my own servers about 6 years ago.&nbsp; It started as a learning exercise and things have just evolved into a full time thing.&nbsp; 

I have both Linux and Windows running for a number of reasons.&nbsp; Both are patched nightly and I do my best to run both platforms as any enterprise shop would ( with the resources I can afford ). 

Having said that my Linux machine was compromised causing&nbsp;me a great deal of pain and frustration. Things are almost back to normal.

Just don't ever forget the Internet is the wild wild west.
