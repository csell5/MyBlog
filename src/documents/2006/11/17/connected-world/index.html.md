As a consultant you find yourself all over the place.&nbsp; Today I am headed to downtown Chicago via the good ole train.&nbsp; It's roughly a 1:30 minute ride one way.&nbsp; I normally travel with at least the following:

*   Large cup of Dunkin Donuts ( you know America runs on it )  <li>1 Verizon phone with EVDO  <li>1 Vista machine, 2 batteries  <li>1 set of headphones 

Here is where things get very geeky:

I am currently using the phone as a modem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Blogging, email, IM, banging code all while listening to URGE ( BTW URGE just rocks ).&nbsp; All at 50 mph!&nbsp;&nbsp;If that wasn't enough, the code I am working on is hosted on a remote TFS server I am currently checking&nbsp;things in and out of.&nbsp; CRAZY, I just&nbsp;love it!! 

So what does my current bandwidth look like?
 > Download Speed: **1118** kbps (139.8 KB/sec transfer rate)
> Upload Speed: **119** kbps (14.9 KB/sec transfer rate) 

It's pretty crazy how connected we really are today.
