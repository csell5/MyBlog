&nbsp;Wow, so its really been a long time since I posted any real content. This past year has just been a whirl wind of activities for both my wife and I. We had our first kid, built a new house, yaddaa yaddaa yaaddaa. Before you know it a whole 6 months&nbsp;slipped from&nbsp;your fingers.

So enough of the excuses, lets catch up.

1.  This is my kid Ethan or "E" as we call him, he&nbsp;wanted to say&nbsp;hello! -->  <li>New version of [TFS Power Toys](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=5431080) released. If you haven't installed them yet what are you waiting for? You don't have to install the SDK anymore.  <li>[Martin Woodward](http://woodwardweb.com/) became an MVP! A big congratulations out to him.  <li>[TFS SP1](http://connect.microsoft.com/visualstudio/) Beta was released.  <li>[Jeff Beehler](http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffbe/) started to blog again.
