So just what is TfsAlert?

> TfsAlert is a .Net 3.0 smart client which monitors for subscribed TFS notifications and will display a balloon window in the Windows TaskBar Notification Area.&nbsp; It is built on top of&nbsp;WCF&nbsp;where you can subscribe&nbsp;to any TFS event you feel fit.&nbsp; It's initial focus is around Team Build management but will also include features around Work Item tracking.

How about that for an official&nbsp;party line!

I started TfsAlert back when TFS was in it's beta days.&nbsp; I've used Cruise Control for many years and I just felt naked without the tray, so TfsAlert was born.&nbsp; Yes I have copied some of the feature ideas.&nbsp; So far it has been a great learning experience of not only .

Net 3.0 but TFS integration.&nbsp; I am excited about the expanded development and communities response.

A few minutes ago the [TfsAlert](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=TfsAlert) [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=TfsAlert) how was created.&nbsp; It's going to take me a few days just to get everything transferred over and get a build out, but it's high on&nbsp;my list.&nbsp;
