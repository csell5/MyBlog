Way off the beaten path...

A number of months ago my wife and I finally decided to build a new house.&nbsp; If you have ever gone through the process of building or&nbsp;buying a&nbsp;new home, you know there is an unlimited amount of factors which ultimately affect the purchase and more so your monthly payment.&nbsp; When we started this process I&nbsp;hit the ole Internet in search of a mortgage calculator.&nbsp; I landed on&nbsp;the [Office template section ](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/default.aspx)where I found a [basic mortgage calculator workbook](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/TC062062871033.aspx).&nbsp; That workbook has since been revamped to closer depict&nbsp;a holistic purchase process.

The numbers represented&nbsp;in this spreadsheet are just for demonstrative purposes. [MortgageCalc-2003.zip (36.04 KB)](http://csell.net/content/binary/MortgageCalc-2003.zip)

I hope you find it as useful as I have. Enjoy!
