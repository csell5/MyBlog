Let's face it if you are on a big enterprise development project you most likely will have both platforms, Java and .Net.&nbsp; I am a big fan when it comes to using the right tool for the job.&nbsp; I have been lucky enough to see [Teamprise ](http://teamprise.com)in action on some heterogeneous projects I have been on.&nbsp; It's great to see a product like [it](http://teamprise.com) harness the power and vision of the TFS platform.

Nice job goes out to the&nbsp;staff at&nbsp;[Teamprise](http://teamprise.com)!
