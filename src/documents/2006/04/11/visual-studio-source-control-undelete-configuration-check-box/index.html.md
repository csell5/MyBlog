It's been a while since my last post but I had an opportunity to take a month of vacation when my child was born.&nbsp; Let me just say, it sure didn't feel like a month.

Yesterday I stumbled across some IDE source control configuration gem.&nbsp;&nbsp;While poking around in&nbsp;I ran across "Show deleted items in the Source Control Explorer" in Tools -> Options -> Source Control -> Visual Studio Team Foundation Server.&nbsp; I can't tell you how many times I have been through those options but apparently I just ignored that whole section since it has the proxy server inputs above it.&nbsp; Once checked you will be able to use the undelete features from within the IDE rather than [tf.exe](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc31bk2e(VS.80).aspx).
