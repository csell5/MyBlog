Yesterday I received my copy of: [**Web Service Security **Scenarios, Patters, and implementation guidance for Web Service Enhancements (WSE) 3.0\. 0-7356-2314-7](http://www.bookpool.com/ss?qs=0-7356-2314-7)

So far it looks like a great read.&nbsp; It's one of the first I have seen that&nbsp;addresses patters and practices in&nbsp;the web service security space.
