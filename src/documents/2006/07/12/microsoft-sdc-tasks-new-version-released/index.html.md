If you are doing anything with .Net 2.0 chances are you have a set of MSBuild files supporting your application.&nbsp; That means you already know MSBuild just rocks.&nbsp; What better than MSBuild?&nbsp;MSBuild with a sweet task library to support it of course!&nbsp; That task library would be the [Enterprise Solutions Build Framework](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=b4d6499f-0020-4771-a305-c156498db75e) or [Microsoft.SDC.Tasks](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=b4d6499f-0020-4771-a305-c156498db75e) as I like to call it.

Well they just released a new version!&nbsp; The biggest change was the introduction of BizTalk 2006 tasks.&nbsp; If BizTalk isn't your fancy then you will be pleased to also know there are some new TFS tasks also.

These guys do a stellar job!&nbsp; I have been using this library for about a year now and it goes everywhere&nbsp;I go.
