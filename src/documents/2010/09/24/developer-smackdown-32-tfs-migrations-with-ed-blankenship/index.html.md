When doing a TFS Migration make sure you think about some of the following items:

*   Are you a big TFS project or little TFS Project kind of guy?&#160; Think about your organization and their reporting structures when considering "the size" of your TFS projects.*   Think about how you would report on things?&#160; What types of questions are you trying to answer with your reports?*   Did you know that Branch Visualization doesn't work across Team Projects ( at least as of the time of writing this )*   Treat the migration just like any other product development you would do.*   1 gig of source typically takes 24 hours to migrate.&#160; That is execution time.*   How much history do you really need?&#160; Was it worth the cost to migrate?
