##### Notes from some sessions we saw today:

##### From Cheesy Sample to Social Platform - Scott Hanselman

Scott used the NerdDinner.com site and code to demonstrate some conveniences that you can build into your web site to promote social activities.&#160; You've seen this done on a lot of web sites and Scott pointed out some specific ideas.

*   Use Geo-Location to do things like display information relative to the user's current location.&#160; So using services you can use the client IP address and find where the user is "calling from".&#160; With that you can show maps, do more contextual lookups, etc.*   Implement hooks into social connections like Twitter and Facebook.&#160; Though user click permission, post what the user is currently doing, or planning or reading about, etc.*   Use approaches like Open Search to create more standardized search results within your site*   Use MicroFormats which is additional markup attributes to provide metadata for information displayed in your site pages to promote better searching, crawling, etc.*   Provide flexibility in the way users are authenticated through multiple login services (OpenID, YahooID, etc.) possibly in addition to standard forms authentication*   Provide for RSS feeds on your content  

##### Overview of Windows Phone 7 Series Application Platform - Charlie Kindle

This session was packed! Charlie showed the concepts and goals that went into the development of the application platform for WP7 and demonstrated how all of it became a reality.

*   Integrated Experience - "Hubs" and the "3 Screens" (People, Office, Pictures, Music/Video, Marketplace and Games)*   Hardware
        *   Consistent capabilities across all phones*   1 resolution at launch (800x480)*   2nd added later (480x320)*   Same touch capabilities*   Consistent CPU*   Consistent RAM*   Optional physical keyboard*   Experience = People + Standards + Server Code + Client Code (Demo: MIX Scheduler on the phone)*   Users need to be able to customize the phone*   Developers need the ability to be profitable*   Enable all this through the cloud*   2 types of applications
        *   "Apps" - Silverlight*   Games - XNA*   Useable sandbox*   Service-based application deployment*   Emulator has to be realistic (Phone OS compiled for x86 in a VM)
