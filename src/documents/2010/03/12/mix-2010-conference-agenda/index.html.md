[Musing #17 on DeveloperSmackdown.com](http://developersmackdown.com/archives/SingleShow/17) [Mark](http://marknic.com) and I talked about a few techniques \ thoughts on how we handle conferences like Mix. We're not pro's, but over the years they seem to at least work for us.

Conferences are a great place to network with all kinds of people.&#160; I usually try to plan on both formal and informal visits with people.&#160; I like to start planning "formal like visits" as much as three months out.&#160; Now of course, that all depends on what type of event your going to.&#160; At this years MVP summit, I knew I would be going 3+ months out and since it was at the mother ship it was a great opportunity to meet with different members of the product groups.

As for this trip to Mix, I have the following lined up:

*   7 podcasts*   1 tentative podcast*   1 formal party*   1 tentative dinner event*   Pre-Conference day long training event  

I guarantee this will change the minute I get off the plane.&#160; You have to be flexible at any event because things are <u>always</u> changing. 

Ironically, I don't pay to much attention to the conference sessions until about a week out.&#160; Honestly like everyone else, I have to many other things going on to try and worry about it.&#160; Things change so why waste the time. In fact things can change up to the minute. Given that about a week out I start to make my plan my schedule.&#160; I always plan 2 to 3 session per track.&#160;&#160; A session might end up to full or hell even miss leading.&#160; If you get in and it's not what you want, CUT BAIT and LEAVE.

So what do my days look like ( FWIW my session picks are not stack ranked )?

##### Sunday - Travel and Pre-Conference

I am taking the first flight out.&#160; I have family matters to take care of on Saturday so I will be rushing to get out to Vegas.&#160; Once I land I will get checked in and head to my pre-conference session.&#160; I will be spending the entire day doing a little training. Things will end around dinner.&#160; At which point I am sure I hook up with a number of guys for dinner and drinks.

##### Thursday - Travel Date

Basically a travel day.&#160; Once home I will try to spend a few minutes gathering my thoughts while things are fresh in my head.&#160; Then I will try to build out a plan of the stuff I either want to re-review or plan to see at some point.

Oh man, it's going to be a busy week. I hope to see you at Mix
