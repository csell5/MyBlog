Who is Travis Feirtag you ask?
  > First and foremost, I am a proud father and loving husband for my wonderful family.&#160; My wife, Julie and our four children live in Lake Mills, Wisconsin.&#160; It is unbelievable watching our children grow and learn.&#160; My chest puffs up with pride when I speak of them.&#160; They are the best part of my life. 
> 
> Secondly, I have been an engineer since I got my first computer when I was ten years old.&#160; It is my second love after my family, of course.&#160; If there is such a thing as destiny then it was fateful that I have become an engineer.&#160; I drive my wife crazy talking about technology.&#160; Of course, if our children love tech as much as their dad then mommy is in trouble :) 
> 
> I have spent many years working, exploring, making mistakes and learning from them.&#160; In my opinion, it is truly through our mistakes that we gain the most useful experience in life.&#160; I believe that I am open-minded about new technologies but I do not adopt a technology simply because it is new.&#160; I have a considerable amount of experience but there always is so much more to know.&#160; For the last nine years, I have been spending most of my time using .NET technologies.&#160; Microsoft has done their homework when creating the .NET framework.&#160; It is the most cohesive set of development technologies from them to date. 
> 
> I was on the executive committee of the Wisconsin .NET User Group for 3 years. And was the president of the Madison .NET User Group for two years and I now serve on the Board of Directors, which means that I am involved in the regional and national .NET developer community.&#160; I have been a full-time engineering consultant in the Southern Wisconsin region for over 10 years now.
