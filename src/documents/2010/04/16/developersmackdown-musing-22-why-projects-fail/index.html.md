#### Show Notes

Why do so many projects fail?&#160; Well, in our experience, it has to do with some combination of the following:

*   Statement of Work*   Conditions of Satisfaction*   Define "Done"*   Define Assumptions*   Requirements
        *   Can change - just not constantly*   Good ones can actually be tested*   Use Business Analysts for appropriate context*   Build and Deployment: How to get the application created and installed - <u>always</u> underestimated  

Cover your ass with detailed status reports (Weekly!)

*   What did you do this week*   What is planned for next week*   What did you do that was unplanned (KEY! - This is why you didn't finish everything you planned)*   What resources do you need to get the job done*   What issues are blocking you  

Document, Document, Document!!!
