Yep you heard it right.&#160; [Scott Seely](http://twitter.com/sseely) and I are hosting two PDC recap events.

*   Waukesha, WI - November 5th - [Register Here](http://bit.ly/pdcWaukesha)
*   Downers Grove, IL - November 11th - [Register Here](http://bit.ly/pdcDownersGrove)  

Hope to see you there!&#160; Details are below.

* * *

Watching the PDC10 keynote online helps you keep up to speed on what is going on, but wouldn't it even be better to watch the keynotes with a bunch of fellow Microsoft developers? Of course it is! Join about 100 other developers to watch the PDC 10 keynotes in the morning and dig into the PDC 10 labs in the afternoon. You bring a&#160; laptop, we'll supply mentors, instructors, and some fun. 

Lunch will be provided.
