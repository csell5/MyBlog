On Thursday ( 12/3 ) I have the opportunity to speak at the Wisconsin Azure User Group.&#160; I want to first say ***thank you*** for the invite, [Wade](http://blog.wadewegner.com/) and I had a blast talking with everyone.

We managed to cover a great deal of information.&#160; I am going to try and just hit the high points, attach some demo's, etc.

**PDC Roundup**

[Wade](http://blog.wadewegner.com/) covered Azure and specifically:

*   Windows Azure*   AppFabric*   Dallas*   SQL Azure  

Rather than going into each of the different topics just check out [Wade's blog post](http://blog.wadewegner.com/index.php/2009/12/06/wi-azure-user-group-windows-azure-platform-update/) for everything he covered.&#160; 

During my part of the talk ( i.e. what Wade decided to leave me ), I covered the Silverlight 4 announcements along with a number of random .NET announcements.&#160; You can see all of that in the presentation below:

**DEMO's DEMO's DEMO's**

I couldn't do I also did a few demos, specifically:

1.  A printing technique in .NET and WPF.2.  Basic MEF, or Hello World with MEF3.  ASP.NET MVC in concert with MEF.&#160; Here we used MEF to dynamically load a portion of the MVC site.  

You can download the source for those demos here:
