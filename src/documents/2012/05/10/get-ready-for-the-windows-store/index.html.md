Recently, the Windows Store blog [announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsstore/archive/2012/04/18/windows-store-expanding-to-new-markets.aspx) that in the next significant Windows 8 preview release they will be expanding their global coverage with 33 additional app submission locales for developers.&#160; Our store services are ramping up as planned--and of course the plan includes ramping up developer registrations to enable app submissions to the Windows store. Today, you need an invite "token" to register. 
  > This begs the question - **How can YOU get a token?**  

It's easy! If your app is ready and you want to be among those developers who get to submit to the store early, simply attend one of the 100s of free Application Excellence Labs that DPE and Windows are holding around the world.

Follow these steps to get invited to an App Excellence lab:
  > 1\. Contact me [csell@microsoft.com](mailto:csell@microsoft.com) for instructions on how I can nominate your app for an excellence lab.
> 
> 2\. Create a really great Windows 8 Metro style app (or game) immediately. Get it as ready as if you were submitting to the store.  

Hopefully, there will be a lab near you. Right now, we have labs in 40+ countries and we may be adding more.

Of course, coming to the lab is not all you have to do. I have to go back to step #1: You need to have a compelling, functional app that follows our [UX guidelines](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465424), our [performance best practices](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh750312.aspx), and our store [certification requirements](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh694083.aspx)

The lab is a 4-hour engagement with a trained Microsoft Services Engineer. This person will run your app through a series of tests based on a quality checklist to ensure your app is (or will be) in top-notch shape when you submit. You will also get a chance discuss ways to make your app even better and you will get answers to any questions you might have. 

If your app meets the criteria, then booyah! You get a token to register your developer account and (once you have been verified and all that) you will be able to submit your app to the Windows store.&#160; If your app does not meet the criteria, nothing is lost. You will still end up with a much better app and you will be able to submit it when registration opens for all developers.

Good luck. We are looking forward to seeing your apps and helping you to make them great!
