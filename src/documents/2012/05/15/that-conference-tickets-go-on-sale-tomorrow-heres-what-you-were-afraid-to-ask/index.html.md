After over a year of planning, tickets finally go on sale tomorrow for That Conference.[![ThatConf_logo](ThatConf_logo_thumb.png "ThatConf_logo")](http://csell.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ThatConf_logo.png) I wanted to just take a quick moment and answer some potential questions you might have before tomorrow.

## Tickets

Tickets will be on sale tomorrow at **8:13am CST for $349\. **We're not doing any early birds, discounts, blaa, blaa, blaa. That $349 covers you for breakfast, lunch, swag and a few other things that we will announce later on. You will purchase tickets through EventBrite at [http://thatconference2012.eventbrite.com/](http://thatconference2012.eventbrite.com/). There is also a link on our home page that will redirect later on tonight.

We expect to sell out rather fast so don't delay. We have a waitlist setup, so if you don't get in, you never know we might just open up more. Our goal is to include everyone assuming we have the staff to handle it.

## Hotel

We have a block rate setup with the Kalahari. You can find more details about it at: [http://thatconference.com/Resources/Travel](http://thatconference.com/Resources/Travel) The discount is a rolling discount so if you desire a different room that is ok, we have you covered. The block is first come first serve. The Kalahari is awesome you can see more about it at [http://www.kalahariresorts.com/wi/](http://www.kalahariresorts.com/wi/).

## Sessions and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Speakers</span> Counselors

All of our sessions have been posted to: [http://thatconference.com/Sessions](http://thatconference.com/Sessions). If that wasn't awesome enough we have a few more tricks up our sleeve. We also have our speakers bio's here: [http://thatconference.com/Speakers](http://thatconference.com/Speakers) but we're still setting up that tent in camp. Soon we will have some high res head shoots of our counselors.

## The Schedule

Coming. Honestly we've been so busy getting things ramped up and settled for tomorrow we're just not there. You will not be at a loss for things to do, just start to practice your cannon balls and laser tag skills.

## The Pre-Parties

I am hoping you know by know we're having a number of pre-events going on leading up to the actual conference and they are all free.

### A Date with 8
