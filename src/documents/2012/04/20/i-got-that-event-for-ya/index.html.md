I wanted to just take a few minutes and detail a number of events coming up ( here in the Midwest ) in which you might just be interested in attending. In fact, if you're looking to get involved with Windows 8, I would love to know. I am looking for passionate people to help me teach, run labs, office hours and more. Please just email me, and lets chat.

Ready, set,,,, take a breath,,, GO

**The Windows Developer Event aka The Windows 8 Kick Off**

Next Thursday April 26th, Chicago IL

[Registration Link](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032508899&Culture=en-US)
> There are still some spots left for what I consider the kickoff event for what will be some exciting times with Windows 8\. We're going to spend the entire day with some of the best designers and developers across the Midwest introducing you to the new world of Windows 8\. We will start off the day exploring how computing has changed and how Windows 8 is here to help you. We will hear from guys down in the trenches building applications for the Windows Store. Then it's time to get dirty with Metro and what it really means. But wait, why not also see how to do some development with Kinect. Of course we can't go through the day without understand just how the cloud fits into everything and how can we make some cash.>

> Oh yea, we will have robot's too. Why? Why Not!
**Get your head out of the clouds, HTML5 is here, and the Web will never be the same!**

April 27th, Appleton WI

> You've no doubt heard that before, or something like it. We'd guess that when you did, you got excited, rolled your eyes, or mouthed the word "why?" and furrowed your brow. Perhaps your reaction was a mix of all three.> 
> 
> We wouldn't blame you for any of those reactions. HTML5 is exciting, and it does have the potential to change the Web as we know it, but it also gets blown out of proportion. What's more, its true meaning can be elusive. It's a broad topic, so it's difficult to wrap your head around HTML5, much less know where to begin with this exciting new set of technologies.> 
> 
> And then there is the cloud. The cloud is changing the way we think about computing.> 
> 
> That's where our bootcamp comes in.> 
> 
> Over the course of a one-day, we (Clark Sell and Brian Prince) will tell you everything you need to know to get started with the next generation of open web technologies and cloud. We'll start with an overview of what HTML5 is, and why it matters, before moving quickly through major aspects of the core HTML5 specifications. Then, we'll discuss highlights of CSS3, major new JavaScript APIs and language features, before we end with a discussion on graceful degradation and adopting HTML5 without leaving older browsers behind.  Throughout the day, we'll mix in hands-on exercises and labs so that you can leave with a working understanding of these technologies, and how you can begin to apply them immediately.>

> But what good is your website without a place to put it? To the cloud!
