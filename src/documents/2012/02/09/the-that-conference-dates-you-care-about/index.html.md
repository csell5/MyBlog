&#160;

**April 2nd ( Monday )**

*   Call for speakers **<u>opens</u>**. We will have a signup form on [http://](http://thatConference.com)[thatConference](http://thatconference.com/).com</a> where you will be enter the appropriate information.  

**April 16th ( Monday )**

*   Call for speakers **<u>closes</u>**. Yes that means you have two weeks to get your abstracts in, but there is plenty of prep time.  

&#160;

{ feel free to bribe the organizers here. j/k }

&#160;

**May 1st ( Tuesday )**

*   That Conference will announce the speaker lineup.  

**May 16th ( Wednesday )**

We're all developers, you know what happens when there isn't a date out there.&#160; If your planning on submitting a session abstract, start getting those bad boys ready. **<u></u>**

**<u>Be creative and think different.</u>**
