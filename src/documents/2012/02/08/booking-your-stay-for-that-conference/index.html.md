This might sound a bit premature given That Conference is in August, but you can actually book your hotel stay now. At first this may seem a bit backwards but given the conference takes place in August, I want to make sure people have amply time plan their summers and book their rooms.

&#160;

We have a block of rooms at a discounted rate of $169.00, when making a reservation make sure you refer them the block name: "**That Conference**" or Booking ID: "**20532**". You can do that either online or via phone:

*   [Online Reservation,](https://res.kalahariresort.com/v1web//Availability.asp?WCI=Groups&WCE=GroupSelect&BookID=20532&GroupPassword=37005375) select _make reservation_
*   877-253-5466

a note from the past for the future -

One of the goals of mine as we are planning That Conference is to provide transparency into the process, a peek behind the curtain if you will. Maybe your trying to plan something too, and hopefully this provided you one ounce of help.
