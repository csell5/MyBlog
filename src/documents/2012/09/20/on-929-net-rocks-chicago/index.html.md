2 years ago Richard Campbell and Carl Franklin jumped in an RV and drove across the United States stopping in every major city recording a live .NET Rocks show. One of their stops was Chicago Code Camp right here in![](DNRRoadTripWeb.jpg) well Chicago.

&nbsp;

**Well, they're back! **With the release of Visual Studio 2012 and Windows 8 they decided to get a bigger RV and do it again BUT this time we're taking advantage of them. On **9/29 { next Saturday&nbsp; }** .NET Rocks and [That Conference](http://thatConference.com) are throwing a special 1 day only free event ( lunch provided ). Attendees have a day to immerse themselves in Windows 8, Visual Studio, Azure and at the end watch a live recording of .NET Rocks. This is great opportunity for anyone interested in the Microsoft platform.

&nbsp;

**We only have 250 seats and it's next Saturday. Please don't wait around to register.**

&nbsp;

Details, agenda and registration can all be found at [http://oneday.thatconference.com](http://oneday.thatconference.com)

Hope to see you there...
