Did you miss //build? Well there is another show in town, [DevIntersection](http://devintersection.com). I have always been a huge supporter of community and the power that exists in it. When we started [That Conference](http://thatconference.com/) we always said we would help out our fellow communities to the best of our ability. Today I am happy to share $50 off at [DevIntersection](http://devintersection.com) using my promo code, SELL. 

**December 9th - 12th** at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas you can see a pretty [stellar lineup](http://devintersection.com/shows/sessions.aspx?s=1). Scott Hanselman, Scott Guthrie, Kate Gregory, Tim Huckaby and many more.

*   Register by November 15th and you will get a free Windows 8 Tablet.
*   Use registration code **SELL** and you will get another $50 off. 

~ Enjoy
