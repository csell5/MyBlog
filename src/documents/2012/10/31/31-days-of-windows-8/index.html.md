Tomorrow aka: November, 1st, 2012, my first "31 Days" software development series will kick off, focused on Windows 8 development.&nbsp; I have teamed up my colleague and friend [Jeff Blankenburg](http://jeffblankenburg.com/) to publish a new 31 days series focused on Windows 8 Store App development using both HTML5\JS and XAML\C#. I will focus on HTML5 while Jeff will focus on XAML.

Given the amount of content we will be producing we wrote a simple Website at [http://www.31daysofwindows8.com](http://www.31daysofwindows8.com). You can think of this as your index to everything related to the 31 Day of Windows 8\. We will update it daily with the new articles as well as the supporting links for each topic. be updated daily with links to the published articles.
