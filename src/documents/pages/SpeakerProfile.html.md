Today it evokes emotions, connects families while fundamentally changing the way we live as human beings. This so called mobile revolution is taking place right now, right in front of you, but are you really taking full advantage of it or even worse leaving money on the table?

## My Bio

**Clark Sell, Senior Program Manager and Developer Advocate, Microsoft**

Clark is a developer advocate and program manager for Microsoft DPE based in Illinois. A Chicago native who can’t spell, Clark as a kid actually made his money building cars, getting grease under his nails. That art of building would later lead him to software development where he drinks the Web and Mobile Development Kool-Aid. At Microsoft, Clark spends his days working with Global ISVs helping them deliver their top products leveraging Windows 8, Windows Phone and Windows Azure. As of that wasn’t enough, Clark is the co-founder of a polyglot software development conference called That Conference http://ThatConference.com. You can check out his blog at http://csell.net or find his family cruising around in their 1968 Camaro SS.
