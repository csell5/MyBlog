# Hi, My Name is Clark!

I'm a proud Husband and Father of 2 beautiful kids. I'm currently called a Program Manager and Developer Advocate working for Microsoft as one of those "remote worker types". I grew up and still do live outside of Chicago or Milwaukee but I'll let you pick. I was born with the natural gift of misspelling.

At Microsoft, I spend my days working with market moving Global ISVs, helping them deliver their top products, leveraging Windows 8, Windows Phone and Windows Azure. I fight for what I think is right, while trying to make a difference in everything I manage to touch.

As a kid I made my money building cars, getting grease under my nails. That art of building has lead me to where you see me today. I love everything related to the Web, Mobility, Micro-Controllers, JavaScript and even Photoshop. Over the past few years I've managed to find my inner "designer". I try to exploit it at any given opportunity especially while my family and I cruise around in our '68 Camaro SS.

But, I'm an entrepreneur at heart and I love community. I founded and and president of the most awesome family friendly polyglot software developers conference, That Conference http://ThatConference.com. Our goal is simple help build the most awesome community while exposing our kids to our craft.

If you've made it this far and still want more just head over to my [complete bio](http://clarksell.info).

Lastly, please don't call me Chris.
