# Hi, My Name is Clark!

I'm a proud Husband and Father of 2 beautiful kids. I'm a Product Manager at Telerik focused on mobility. I grew up and still do live outside of Chicago or Milwaukee, but I'll let you pick. Die hard Bears fan, grease monkey and all around geek, I was born with the natural gift of misspelling.

At Telerik, I spend my days focused on how we can enable the enterprise, it’s developers and our partners in building incredible experiences which advance today’s modern business. I work closely with our engineering teams, customers and partners, understanding how each together can be more awesome than they were just the day before while advancing our society together. 

As a kid I made my money building cars, getting grease under my nails. That art of building has lead me to where you see me today. I love everything related to the Web, Mobility, Micro-Controllers, JavaScript and even Photoshop. Over the past few years I've managed to find my inner "designer". I try to exploit it at any given opportunity especially while my family and I cruise around in our '68 Camaro SS.

But, I'm an entrepreneur at heart and I love community. I founded and and president of the most awesome family friendly polyglot software developers conference, That Conference http://ThatConference.com. Our goal is simple help build the most awesome community while exposing our kids to our craft.
