[Jeff Beehler](http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffbe/) and [Buck Hodges](http://blogs.msdn.com/buckh/) both decided to tag me and I hear tag backs are not allowed.  So it's time to kick off this new year of blogging with a few items you may have never guessed.

1.  I have a 10 month old son, Ethan.  It's amazing just how fast your life can change. 

2.  I love Motorsports.  While there is number of different leagues, I most enjoy watching NASCAR.  A few friends and I try to attend one race a year and so far I have been to Michigan, Charlotte, Atlanta, Memphis and Indy.

3.  Given I love Motorsports you could imagine I also love cars.  So much so I am actually doing my own body off restoration on a 1970 Camaro.  Yes it's turned into a slow moving project but it's still a great time when I get to turn some wrenches and lay a few welds.

4.  I didn't aspire to be a programmer when I went to college. In fact I really didn't aspire to do anything much with computers but I loved the internet.  My father was a geek since the dawn of time so I had always grew up around them.  At that point in time I would have just rather worked on cars.  Once I got into college that quickly changed and I graduated with an IT degree.  My first job out of college was actually working on the ole Y2K bug.

5.  I am an Eagle Scout.
