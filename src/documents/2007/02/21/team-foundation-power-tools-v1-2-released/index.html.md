Team Foundation Server is happy to announce the release of version 1.2 of Team Foundation Power Tools (formerly known as Power Toys).  In this release we've added 2 new command line tools for the developer and 3 non-command line tools.   This version includes some bug fixes to previous Power Tools, support for Vista, and adds the following new functionality: 

*   **Workspace Command (tfpt.exe) - **Use the workspace command for additional workspace operations not supported in the currently shipping Team Foundation Server command line (tf.exe). **
			**
*   **Treeclean Command (tfpt.exe) -** Use the treeclean command to see and optionally delete files in the current directory and all subdirectories that are not under version control.

*   **Process Template Editor - **A tool to provide UI for authoring work item types and some of the associated Process Template components.  

*   **Check-in Policy Pack - **A set of handy check-in policies to address needs customers have expressed.

*   **Build Test Tools Task - **A tool that allows running unit tests by simply specifying the DLLs or even specifying a file name pattern in TfsBuild.proj, instead of using .vsmdi files to specify tests to run.

<a name="Requirements"/>Please note that the Process Template Editor has some additional pre-requisites, they are identified on the download page.
